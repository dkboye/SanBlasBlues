Love it seems I just can't find
Love it seems I just can't find
It seems that I'm the one Love
The one love left behind

I've searched it doesn't come my way
I've searched it doesn't come my way
It's lovin' I want boy
So what more can I say

SOLO

Women they seem to pass me by
Women they seem to pass me by
If I could find the reason
I'd know the answer why

Love it seems I just can't find
Love it seems I just can't find
It seems that I'm the one Love
The one love left behind
