FORTUNATE SON

Some folks are born made to wave the flag
Ooh, they're red, white and blue
And when the band plays "Hail To The Chief"
Ooh, they point the cannon at you, Lord

    It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no senator's son, son
    It ain't me, it ain't me; I ain't no fortunate one, no

Some folks are born silver spoon in hand
Lord, don't they help themselves, oh
But when the taxman comes to the door
Lord, the house looks like a rummage sale, yes

    It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no millionaire's son, no, no
    It ain't me, it ain't me; I ain't no fortunate one, no

Puente

Some folks inherit star spangled eyes
Ooh, they send you down to war, Lord
And when they ask you, "How much should we give?"
Ooh, they only answer, "More! More! More!" Yo

    It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no military son, son
    It ain't me, it ain't me; I ain't no fortunate one, one

    It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, no no no
    It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate son, no no no

SOLO [C -> A]

    It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no senator's son
    It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one
    It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no senator's son
