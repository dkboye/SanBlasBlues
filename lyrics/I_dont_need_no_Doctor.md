### I Don't Need No Doctor
---
I don't need no Doctor  
'Cause I know what's ailing me (x2)  
I've been too long away from my baby  
I'm coming down with a misery

I don't need no doctor  
For my prescription to be filled (x2)  
Only my baby's arms,  
Could ever take away this chill

Now the doctor say I need rest  
Before I need her tenderness  
Put me on the critical list  
When all I need is her sweet kiss  
He gave me a medicated lotion  
But it didn't soothe my emotion

I don't need no doctor  
For my hope to live is gone (x2)  
All I need is my baby  
Baby, Please!  
Won't you please come on home
