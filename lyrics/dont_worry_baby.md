INTRO

Standin' there by the window
Starin' out at the night
You've got so many troubles
On your nerv-ous mind
Well don't worry baby
It's gonna be alright

You hear the sound of footsteps
Stealing 'cross the floor
You picked up the receiver
You didn't know what for
Then you saw a shadow
Headin' out the door

Puente

    Well don't worry baby
    What the world may bring
    Well don't worry baby
    Ain't gonna change a thing
    Life is a fly
    And then you die

SOLO

Standin' near by the window
Starin' out at the night
You see your lover leanin'
Against the old street light
Well don't worry baby
It's gonna be alright

He was tossin' and turnin'
And he couldn't sleep
He said you shouldn't bother
It was just a dream
Then where was he goin'
Headin' down the street

    Well don't worry baby...
